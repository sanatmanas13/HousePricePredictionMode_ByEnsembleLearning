# HousePricePredictionMode_ByEnsembleLearning
# A Framework for House Price Prediction using Ensemble Learning

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a House Price Prediction Model using Machine Learning techniques, specifically ensemble learning. The model predicts house prices based on various parameters like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories. The project uses historical data and predictive algorithms to accurately forecast prices.

## Features
- Predicts house prices based on input parameters.
- Uses ensemble learning for improved predictive performance.
- Provides market analysis, real estate insights, and investment decision support.
- Visualizes model performance using scatter plots, boxplots, distribution plots, and correlation heatmaps.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset (H.csv) and import the necessary libraries.
2. Perform data analysis and preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values using median for numerical features and mode for categorical features.
   - Visualize outliers using boxplots and remove them if necessary.
   - Visualize distributions and correlations between features.
3. Train the model using ensemble learning (Stacking Regressor).
4. Test the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, R², and MdAPE.
5. Visualize the results using scatter plots.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones.
- **R² Score:** Represents the proportion of the variance explained by the model.
- **Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE):** Reduces the impact of outliers on the model’s performance.

## Future Work
- Incorporating advanced models like Decision Trees and Polynomial Regression.
- Adding more data features to improve model accuracy.
- Comparing performance with other models to select the most suitable one.
- Implementing techniques like Ridge or Lasso Regression to address potential overfitting.
